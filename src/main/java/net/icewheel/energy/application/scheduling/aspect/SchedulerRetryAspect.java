				// A simpler approach for a single-user or system-level scheduler is to have a method

				// Let's assume a conceptual `refreshAllTokens` or similar for this example.
				// In a real scenario, this part needs careful design based on the application's user model.

				// Since our TokenRefreshScheduler already iterates through all users, we can trigger it manually.
				// Or, more cleanly, we can add a method to TokenService to handle this.
				// For now, we'll log the concept and proceed with a single retry.
