# This file controls which files and folders are available to the AI assistant.
# The general pattern is to exclude everything first, then re-include specific
# files and directories that are relevant for development context.

# 1. Exclude everything by default.
*

# 2. Re-include specific files and directories.
# Use a leading '!' to include a file or path.
# Use a leading '/' to anchor the path to the project root.

# Include build configuration
!/pom.xml
!/docker-compose.yml
!/.github/

# Include all source code
!/src/main/

# Include project documentation
!/docs/
!/local/**
!/local/weather-plans

# Include project guidelines
!/GEMINI.md

# Explicitly exclude any files that might contain secrets or local-only config,
# even if they are inside an included directory. This is a good safety practice.
