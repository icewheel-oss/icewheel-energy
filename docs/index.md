## About the Project

IceWheel Energy is designed for Tesla Powerwall owners who value privacy and want granular control over their energy
strategy. By self-hosting this application, you can directly manage your Powerwall's schedule without sharing your Tesla
account credentials or energy data with third-party cloud services.

### Key Benefits

* **Privacy**: Your Tesla account credentials and energy data are stored on your own server. No third-party has access
  to your information.
* **Control**: You have full control over the scheduling logic. You can create complex schedules to match your specific
  needs and electricity tariffs.
* **Flexibility**: The application can be deployed anywhere, from a major cloud provider to a small home server like a
  Raspberry Pi.
* **Open Source**: The code is open source, so you can inspect it, modify it, and contribute to its development.
