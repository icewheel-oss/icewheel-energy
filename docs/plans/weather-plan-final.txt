Great idea. Here’s how to extend the design to support multiple weather providers, allow users to enter their own API keys/secrets via the UI, and use a resilient multi-provider strategy with quotas, caching, and fallbacks.

Goals
- Let each user connect one or more weather providers (free tiers welcome) via UI-managed API keys/secrets.
- Normalize provider data to a common forecast model.
- Use a provider-agnostic decision engine with caching and rate-limit awareness.
- Fail over to the next provider automatically if one is down or out of quota.
- Keep secrets secure (encryption at rest, masking, never log).

Key components to add

1) Data model (new entities)
- WeatherProviderCredential
  - id, userId, providerType (open-meteo, OPENWEATHER, TOMORROWIO, NOAA, METEOBLUE, etc.)
  - apiKey, apiSecret (nullable; encrypted at rest)
  - label (user-friendly name) and enabled flag
  - createdAt, updatedAt
- WeatherForecastCache (required, save in database, come up with clever approach to save WeatherForecastCache from different weather data providers)
  - id, userId, siteId (or location key), providerType, lookaheadHours, validFrom/validTo
  - summary metrics: avgCloudCover, precipProbabilityMax, hasSnow/Rain/Storm, providerConfidence
  - rawPayload (JSON), hash, createdAt, ttl/expireAt
- Per-user weather preference
  - Default provider priority list
  - Conservative vs normal forecasting mode
  - Location override per energySite if not resolvable automatically

2) UI/UX
- Settings > Weather Providers
  - Add Provider: dropdown of supported providers
  - Fields: API key, API secret (if needed), label, enable/disable
  - Validate credentials on save (probe a harmless endpoint)
  - Mask secrets; allow rotate/revoke; show last successful call timestamp and call count (with date)
- Schedule UI
  - Toggle: Weather-aware charging
  - Inputs: badWeatherChargePercent, thresholds (cloud cover, precip), lookahead hours, charge-only-during-off-peak
  - Location: default from energy site; allow override
  - Provider priority: optionally let users order providers (drag/drop) or accept sensible default

3) Backend abstractions
- WeatherClient (per provider implementation) and common DTOs:
  - WeatherClient.fetchForecast(location, lookahead, siteZoneId) -> NormalizedForecast
  - Each provider maps its schema to NormalizedForecast
- WeatherProviderRegistry
  - Lists installed providers and capabilities
- WeatherClientFactory
  - Given userId + siteId, returns a prioritized ProviderChain that:
    - Filters enabled providers with valid credentials
    - Orders by user preference, then provider health and recent errors/quota usage
- ForecastCacheService
  - Cache per user + site + time window; TTL 30–60 minutes
  - Cache key includes provider and window; also allow “any provider” cache when normalized result is indistinguishable
- WeatherForecastEvaluator
  - Input: NormalizedForecast, thresholds, daylight window (site ZoneId)
  - Output: GOOD | BAD | UNKNOWN + confidence + reason
- Rate limiting and quotas
  - ProviderCallLimiter with per-provider rules (local bucket + backoff on 429s)
  - Uses per-user credential ID in the limit key to avoid cross-user interference

4) Provider chain logic
- Fetch path:
  - Check cache; if fresh and within TTL, use it
  - Otherwise iterate providers in priority order:
    - If rate limit would be exceeded, skip to next
    - Call provider, honor backoff if recent failures
    - On success: normalize, store cache, return
    - On failure: log reason (without secrets), move on
  - If all fail, return UNKNOWN with fallback policy (e.g., treat as GOOD to avoid unnecessary charge unless user sets conservative mode)
- Decision path (unchanged in spirit):
  - If forecast=BAD and now is off-peak (or within upcoming off-peak start), set target SOC to max(userBackup, badWeatherChargePercent)
  - Avoid oscillation with a per-window “already-set” flag

5) Security and secret management
- Encryption at rest for apiKey/apiSecret using JCE or a KMS (if available to the user)
- Mask values in logs and responses; only last 4 chars visible if necessary
- Never log raw requests with secrets; use separate safe logging fields
- Add “Test connection” button in UI that hits a backend validation endpoint (returns only success/failure + message)
- On rotation: keep old credential disabled for a controlled period if wanted, then purge

6) Location handling
- Default: derive lat/lon from energy site
- Override: allow user to provide lat/lon or provider location ID (e.g., grid point or postal code) per site
- Normalize internally to lat/lon, then map to provider formats in WeatherClient implementations

7) Scheduling integration (recap with multi-provider)
- Pre-off-peak job or continuous reconciliation uses WeatherClientFactory to obtain ProviderChain
- Evaluate forecast result
- If BAD and allowed to charge now, compute target SOC and set it via Tesla API
- Cache the decision for the current off-peak window to avoid repeated updates
- After off-peak ends, revert to normal schedule stewardship

8) Example interfaces and DTOs

```java
public enum WeatherProviderType {
    OPENMETEO,OPENWEATHER, TOMORROWIO, NOAA, METEOBLUE
}

public record Location(double latitude, double longitude) {}

public record NormalizedForecast(
    ZoneId zoneId,
    Instant validFrom,
    Instant validTo,
    double avgCloudCoverPercent,
    double maxPrecipProbabilityPercent,
    boolean hasRain,
    boolean hasSnow,
    boolean hasStorm,
    double providerConfidence, // 0..1
    String providerName
) {}

public interface WeatherClient {
    WeatherProviderType type();
    NormalizedForecast fetchForecast(UUID userId, String siteId, Location location, int lookaheadHours, ZoneId zoneId) throws WeatherClientException;
}

public interface WeatherClientFactory {
    ProviderChain forUserAndSite(UUID userId, String siteId);
}

public interface ProviderChain {
    Optional<NormalizedForecast> getForecast(Location location, int lookaheadHours, ZoneId zoneId);
}

public record ForecastEvaluation(
    boolean badWeather,
    double confidence,
    String reason
) {}

public interface WeatherForecastEvaluator {
    ForecastEvaluation evaluate(NormalizedForecast forecast, ZoneId zoneId, LocalTime dayStart, LocalTime dayEnd,
                                Integer cloudCoverThreshold, Integer precipThreshold, boolean conservativeMode);
}

public interface ForecastCacheService {
    Optional<NormalizedForecast> get(UUID userId, String siteId, int lookaheadHours);
    void put(UUID userId, String siteId, int lookaheadHours, NormalizedForecast forecast, Duration ttl);
}
```


9) Provider implementations
- OpenWeather
  - One Call API for hourly/daily, map clouds (0–100), pop (0–1), weather codes
- Tomorrow.io
  - Timelines API for cloudCover, precipitationProbability, precipitationType, thunderstorm
- NOAA (US)
  - Gridpoints forecast; map to cloud cover/precipitation where available
- Each client:
  - Handles HTTP, retries with exponential backoff, maps to NormalizedForecast
  - Emits a metrics tag like weather_api_calls{provider="OPENWEATHER"} and weather_api_failures{...}

10) Caching and rate limiting
- Cache TTL: 30–60 minutes; longer overnight if forecasts don’t change frequently
-
- Per provider per credential limiters keyed by userId+credentialId
- Respect provider 429/402 (out of quota) by suspending that provider for a cool-down window (e.g., 15–60 minutes)

11) Error handling and fallbacks
- If all providers fail:
  - If conservativeMode enabled: treat as BAD with lower confidence only if thresholds would likely be exceeded based on last-known cache
  - Otherwise treat as GOOD and skip pre-charge
- If partial data:
  - Prefer a completed forecast; if not, compute with available fields and lower confidence

12) Observability
- Structured logs:
  - provider, result, latency, cacheHit, rateLimited
- Metrics:
  - weather_forecast_requests{provider}
  - weather_forecast_cache_hit{provider}
  - weather_forecast_failures{provider,reason}
  - weather_decision_bad/good{siteId}
- Tracing: span around provider calls and decision logic

13) Testing plan
- Unit tests:
  - Evaluator threshold edges
  - ProviderChain fallback when 429/timeout
  - Cache hit/miss and TTL behavior
- Integration tests:
  - Mock provider clients with various responses
  - Credential validation endpoint
  - Scheduler path that only sets SOC during off-peak and only when forecast=BAD
- E2E manual:
  - Configure two providers (one invalid, one valid)
  - Verify fallback to valid
  - Rotate keys and re-validate

14) Configuration and secrets
- application.yml
  - Feature flag: weather.multiProvider.enabled=true
  - Defaults: cache TTL, lookahead default, evaluator thresholds
- Secrets:
  - Store user API keys in DB encrypted with an app key (KMS or password-protected keystore)
  - Never log secrets; redact at the controller/service layer

15) Rollout
- Phase 1: UI for adding providers + backend credential storage with validation
- Phase 2: Single provider usage + cache
- Phase 3: Provider chain with rate limiting and fallback
- Phase 4: Advanced evaluator + per-site overrides and UI polish

If you’d like, I can provide:
- A minimal schema for WeatherProviderCredential and ForecastCache
- Example Spring MVC controller and Thymeleaf form for adding provider keys
- A ProviderChain implementation with OpenWeather + Tomorrow.io as a starting pair
- Tests for the evaluator and provider fallback logic
