## ðŸš€ Try the Live Demo!

Want to see IceWheel Energy in action without installing anything? We've got you covered!

**[Click here to access the live demo](https://energy.icewheel.dev/)**

This is a development environment, so it's a great way to explore the features and see how the application works. However, please keep in mind:

*   **It's not stable for long-term use.**
*   **Data may be reset or deleted weekly.**

We encourage you to try it out, and when you're ready for a stable, private instance, you can follow the instructions below to self-host.

**P.S.** If the site doesn't open, it means we're working on it! We're constantly testing new features and improvements, so check back soon.

IceWheel Energy is a self-hosted application that gives you full control over your Tesla Powerwall charging schedule. By
running your own instance, you can manage your Powerwall's behavior without relying on third-party services, ensuring
your energy data remains private.

This application allows you to create sophisticated schedules to optimize your Powerwall's charging and discharging
cycles based on your electricity tariff (e.g., on-peak and off-peak hours).

**For full documentation, please see the [docs](./docs/index.md) directory.**

## Quick Start

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/icewheel/icewheel-energy.git
    cd icewheel-energy
    ```

2.  **Configure your environment:**
    Create a `.env` file by copying the `.env.example` file. Then, edit the `.env` file to provide the necessary credentials.
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    nano .env
    ```

3.  **Run the application:**
    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:8081` (or the port you specified in your `.env` file).

## Configuration

Configuration is managed through environment variables. You can set these variables in a `.env` file in the project root.
